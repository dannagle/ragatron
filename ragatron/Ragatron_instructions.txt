Ragatron will not work without a valid copy from Humble Bundle!



Welcome to Ragatron!


Make your media edits here. DO NOT MOVE ANY FILES! Instead, directly edit the original files.  All the super-critical files have been secured. If you would like to cheat in the game, those
are available through the Ragatron interface. It will drop in your cheats at the last minute from its own secure copy of the game.

If you mess something up, just click "Unpack" again to undo your changes.
